NREL's Solar Position Algorithm (SPA):

This algorithm calculates the solar zenith and azimuth angles in the period from the year -2000 to 6000, with uncertainties of +/- 0.0003 degrees based on the date, time, and location on Earth. (Reference: Reda, I.; Andreas, A., Solar Position Algorithm for Solar Radiation Applications, Solar Energy. Vol. 76(5), 2004; pp. 577-589). The software has not been tested on a variety of platforms and is not guaranteed to work on yours. It is provided here as a convenience.

How to use this algorithm and a description of the variables is included in the spa.h header file. Further information on this algorithm is available in the following NREL technical report:
